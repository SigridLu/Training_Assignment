1. What type would you choose for the following “numbers”?
String phoneNum;
int height;
int age;
enum gender{ Male, Female, Unspecified}
float salary;
String ISBN;
float price;
double shipWeight;
uint population;
ulong numOfStars;
ushort numOfEmployees;


2. What are the difference between value type and reference type variables?
   Ans: Value type stores its own data on stack while reference type stores a reference to the data in heap.
        Because value type holds itself in memory, if it is assigned to other variable, it make a copy of data on stack without affecting the original value.
        As for reference type, multiple reference variables can be assigned the same reference to a data simaltaniously.
        When modifying the data using any such reference variable, it has direct impact on any other reference variables point to the same data.

3. What happens when you divide an int variable by 0?
   Ans: Compile time error might occure because integer don'r have IsInfinity method in place.

4. What happens when you divide a double variable by 0?
   Ans: Because floating-point types can represent infinity and NaN,
        if we replace constant 1 divide by zero to 1.0f or 1.0d dicide by zero (See in IEEE 754),
        the result would be Infinity which technically doesn't throw exceptions.

5. What happens when you overflow an int variable, that is, set it to a value beyond its range?
   Ans: By default, no exception throw back upon arithmetic overflow. But it might returns an unexpected output.
        We can use checked keyword to trigger OverflowException.

6. What is the difference between x = y++; and x = ++y;?
   Ans: In the first statement presents a post increment on y, the original y value will be assigned to x and then increment itself by one afterwards.
        The next statement presents a pre increment on y. As a result, x will be assigned an incremented y so does y itself. And x == y

7. What is the difference between break, continue, and return when used inside a loop statement?
   Ans: Break statement terminates the loop.
        continue statement starts a new iteration.
        Return statement also terminates the loop and returns the control to the caller.

8. What are the three parts of a for statement and which of them are required?
   Ans: They are the keyword to start the loop, the condition tested before each iteration starts, and the keyword to end the loop.
        None of them are required. for(;;) is the same as while(1).
